        <p>These are the default triggers setup for the company. Triggers are events that occur that a workflow can be
            initiated by, creating a group of interconnected tasks.</p>
        <p>There are two main types of trigger:</p>
        <ul class='ml-12 list-disc a-loose-list'>
            <li>Appointment - events that occurs with appointments</li>
            <li>Task - events that occur in tasks</li>

        <h4>Appointment</h4>
        <ul class='ml-12 list-disc a-loose-list'>
            <li><b>On Create</b> is run when an appointment is created.</li>
            <li><b>On Change</b> is run when an appointment is changed. Only runs if the date/time is changed.</li>
            <li><b>On Attend</b> is run when an appointment status is set to attended.</li>

        <h1 id='set4'>Case Types</h1>
        <h2 id="set4-1">What are Case Types?</h2>
        <p>Case Types are a definition of cases, which is fundamentally a collection of appointments. You can define a
            name,
            description and the number of associated appointments and their types. This does stop you adding more or
            reducing the number of appointments for a case, but give the defaults.</p>
        <h2 id="set4-2">How do I create an case type?</h2>
        <ol class='list-decimal ml-6 mt-6 a-loose-list'>

            <li>You will need to give the template a name, preferably something that is meaningful to its purpose.</li>
            <li>[Optional] You can add a description. This is optional and is there as an aide memoire.</li>
            <li>You then need to define the number of sessions. It defaults to 1.</li>
            <li>Then you will need to set the default appointment type. When you create an appointment this is the
                appointment type used.</li>
            <li>If you have more than 1 session set then you will have access to a initial default appointment type and
                more
                than 2 then a final appointment type.</li>
            <li>Once you have done that you can click the <span class='a-btn a-btn-primary a-btn-save'>Save</span>
                button and you will

                details.
                To do this click 'Add Field' and then select the field you want. The fields menu will insert field
                holders at the cursor. These fields will be filled in when the message is created from the template. See

        <h1 id="set9">Workflow Templates</h1>
        <h2 id="set9-1">What are the workflow templates?</h2>
        <p>Workflow templates are a list of tasks that are used to create active tasks for users when an event has
            occurred (i.e.,a trigger - see below). You can assign workflow templates to a trigger and when the
            trigger is activated then the steps of the workflow are converted into consecutive tasks.</p>
        <div class='a-info-card'>
            Workflow Templates are the superpower to creating an automated workflow in your business.
        </div>
        <h2 id="set9-2">What is a Trigger?</h2>
        <p>A trigger is an event that occurs. An example of this is when you create an appointment. When you click to
            save the appointment, the event of saving an appointment has occurred. In inClinic it is described as the
            appointment 'on create' trigger.</p>
        <p>
            The trigger can be used to run a workflow when it occurs. So to follow the example above, when the
            appointment is saved it triggers the activation of the workflow that sends an email out to the client to
            confirm the appointment.
        </p>
        <p>In settings, under the company section is the tab for triggers. These are the default triggers for inClinic.
        </p>
        <h3 id='set9-21'>Appointment Triggers</h3>
        <p>
            In settings, under the company section is the tab for triggers. These are the default triggers for inClinic
            and can be over ridden if there are values set in the appointment type settings.
        </p>
        <p>There are currently four types of appointment triggers:</p>
        <ul class='a-loose-list list-disc ml-6 mt-6 '>
            <li><b>On Create</b> - Activated when the appointment is saved.</li>
            <li><b>On Change</b> - When a current appointment is updated.</li>
            <li><b>On Attend</b> - When the clinician sets the appointment status to attended.</li>
            <li><b>On DNA</b> - When the clinician sets the appointment status to did not attend.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id='set9-22'>Appointment Type Triggers</h3>
        <p>In Settings, under the appointment types, select an appointment type and then look at the triggers tab.</p>
        <p>
            As described above it contains appointment triggers. If these are added then they will take precedents over
            the
            default ones set in the company settings.

                and you will the see Workflow Template Form.</li>
            <li>You will need to give the template a name, preferably something that is meaningful to its purpose.</li>
            <li><span class='a-optional'>[Optional]</span> You can add a description. This is optional and is there as
                an aide memoire.</li>
            <li>Now you can add the workflow template steps. These are converted into tasks when the template is
                applied. See <a href="./#how-do-i-add-edit-a-workflow-step">&quot;How do I add/edit a workflow
                    step&quot;</a>.</li>

                    class='a-img-vsm mb-1'> edit button at the end
                of the appropriate workflow step. This will open a dialog box.</li>
            <li>The first field is &#39;type&#39;, which defaults to &#39;Task&#39;. The options are:
                <ul class='ml-12 list-disc'>
                    <li>Task - Default step Type</li>
                    <li>Question - Ask the user a question with a Yes/No answer.</li>
                    <li>If...then - If conditions are satisfied then do one thing else do something else (beta)</li>
                    <li>Workflow - Active a new workflow</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Next, you can define whom it is going to be assigned too. It can either be admin, practitioner or bot.
                If a practitioner is activating the creation of tasks then whoever has been assigned to them in the user
                settings will be assigned the admin tasks. If an admin person is activating the task then whoever is
                assigned to the client case is assigned to the practitioner tasks. Finally, if a bot assigned to the
                task the task will be completed automatically doing any actions that have been assigned to it (see step
                4).</li>
            <li>Then you must fill in the description. When you edit this you will see a maximum number of characters
                and a button to add fields to the text. These fields are place holders for the records data. <a
                    href="../../../technical-user-guides/data-dictionary.md">See the data dictionary.</a></li>
            <li>To calculate the due date of each task you can assign the number of days that can be taken on each task.
            </li>
            <li>The last column &#39;Action&#39; means when the task is completed then do an additional operation. If
                the step type is &#39;Question&#39; or &#39;If...Else&#39; then you can choose the true (yes) or false
                (no) path. The options are &#39;continue&#39; in the workflow, end the workflow and clean up any other
                tasks or activate a new workflow. If the step type is &#39;Workflow&#39; you are able to choose the
                workflow to activate. All these require an action. Finally, if the step type is &#39;Task&#39; you can
                choose an optional action on completion. Currently, this can be:
                <ul class='ml-12 list-disc'>
                    <li>Complete Parent - close the case or query associated with the task.</li>

                    <li>Remove Charges - remove all charges from the associated parent.</li>
                    <li>Add Charges - Add charges to the associated parent.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Then click the Save button to add the line. You can repeat this task if you wish to add more task steps.
                On the completion of each step, the next one in the list will be activated.</li>
