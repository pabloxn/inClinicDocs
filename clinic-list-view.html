  <h1>Clinic Appointment List</h1>
  <p>This is where you see your clients for the clinic you are running that day.</p>

  <div class="h-400 flex">
    <img src='assets/pages/clinic-list/image1.png' style='height:400px'>
    <div class='p-5 flex-auto '>
      <p>This consists of two main areas:</p>

      <ul class='list-disc ml-5'>
        <li>The top section is for selecting the venue and date but really should only be needed
          when viewing clinics in
          the future. If you are selecting the clinic date then the dates with clinics set have a small blue dot under
          them.</li>
        <li>The bottom section has a header which shows the progress through the clients and below
          that is the list of
          clients that are to attend the clinic. The icon next to each client signifies the status of the appointment
          and the appointment status can be set by clicking on the icon (see appointment details). The icons definitions
          are below (hovering the mouse pointer over the icon will reveal the status too):</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <h3>Appointment Statuses</h3>
  <table class='a-menu-table'>

        <td>Arrived</td>
        <td>This is an optional status and only applies if you are using a front desk to register that someone has
          arrived at the premises.</td>
      </tr>
