        <h2 id='ht1'>Add an Appointment</h2>
        <p>There are a few methods of adding a new appointment:</p>

        <ul class='mb-6'>
            <li>Via the client wizard (See Client Add Wizard). This is completely dealt with on the Add Wizard page and
                is
                not covered here.</li>
            <li>Via the schedular (See Diary)</li>
            <li>Via the client diary (See Client Diary)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class='list-decimal ml-6'>
            <li>Click on the <span class='rounded-lg bg-gray-300 border-2 border-gray-300 p-0.5'><img
                        src='assets/icons/plus.svg' class='a-img-vsm' /> Add</span> button in client diary or in the
                main
                diary either click on an appointment labelled
                'Empty
                Slot' or select <span class='rounded-lg bg-gray-300 border-2 border-gray-300 p-0.5'><img
                        src='assets/icons/plus.svg' class='a-img-vsm' /> Add Appointment</span> from the action menu on
                the
                toolbar.</li>

            <li>
                A dialog will open. If the appointment was selected by using the client diary then the client details
                will
                be filled
                in and if from the 'Empty Slot' then fill in clinic information.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>[Required]</b> The first field is 'client' and is selectable from a drop down list. The list will be
                filtered if the
                dialog was selected from the 'Empty Slot' by using the clinic venue. It is important to note that the
                client
                has a
                default venue and clinician set up and these will automatically fill in the next 2 fields.
            </li>

            <li><b>[Required]</b> This next field is the venue and defines where the appointment will take place.</li>

            <li><b>[Required]</b> Then is the Clinician field and this defines which the clinician the client will see.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>[Required]</b> The Case field will automatically fill in if the client has only one case, otherwise
                you
                can select from
                the drop down list.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>[Required]</b> The Appointment Type is selectable from a drop down list. The appointment type defines
                many features of
                the appointment. (See Appointment Type). When you select this it will define some information in the
                appointment.
                (Such as what happens when the appointment is attended). It will also set the appointment duration and
                the
                charges
                assigned to the appointment.
            </li>

            <li>Duration (min) sets the length of the appointment. So automatically setting the end time.</li>

            <li>Confirmed sets whether the client has confirmed that they will attend.</li>

            <li>Date sets the appointment dates by clicking the required available clinic date (see above)</li>

            <li>
                The Time dropdown enables the selection of the time slot. The time slots are set by the durations and
                the
                available
                time. They also give freedom to overlap with breaks or day end. If you don't want to use the defined
                slots
                then
                untick Snap To to change the slots to be 5 minutes apart, it will still prevent the use of already taken
                space but
                gives more freedom. The information panel shows you the selected appointment and whether or not it
                overlaps
                with a
                break or the end of a day.
            </li>

            <li>
                The final area Charges are for adding charges to the appointment. It will be automatically be updated
                from
                the
                appointment type, however you can add additional charges.
            </li>

            <li>Click <span class='rounded-lg bg-gray-300 border-2 border-gray-300 p-0.5'><img
