        <p>Workflows are a list of actions or steps that are used to create active tasks for users or automate tasks for
            the system.</p>
        <div class="a-info-card">
            Workflow Templates are the superpower to creating an automated workflow in your business.
        </div>
        <p>Workflows are a list of actions or steps that can do various things. When a workflow is activated it will
            create a number of chained tasks. When one task is completed the next becomes active. You can activate a
            workflow manually or automatically from an trigger event (e.g. When an appointment is created).</p>

        <p>A workflow creates tasks that can either be assigned to a user or to a bot (a piece of code that runs a task
            automatically). Tasks can either be a normal task (e.g. Write report), a question (e.g. Do you want to
            charge for the DNA?) or system activity (e.g. email client a standard email).</p>

        <p>When a series of tasks are created then the first one is set as active. This means that this task is
            available for the user to complete. When this task is completed then the next one in the series is then set
            to active.</p>

        <h2 id='s1-1'>Steps</h2>


        <p>The steps of the task can do other things than just create a task. They can run jobs (e.g. sending an email),
            ask questions and run other workflows. There are 4 types of workflow step:</p>



        <ul class='list-disc a-loose-list mr-6'>
            <li>
                Task - This creates a task that can be assigned to a user or bot. It can also have system actions that
                can run
                when the task is completed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Question - This creates a special task that asks the user (not available to bots) a Yes/No Question. The
                result
                will decide whether a new workflow is run to create tasks or to continue along with the same task chain
            </li>
            <li>
                If...then - This is similar to above except only bots are allowed to complete, which they do on
                activation of
                the task. They use a system field to decide which route to take.
            </li>
            <li>Run Workflow - This will automatically start a new workflow to activate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='s1-2'>Example</h2>
        <p>
            To illustrate I am going to use the example of an appointment that has a status of 'Did Not Attend'(DNA).
            When the appointment was set to DNA the clinician was asked whether they want to create the tasks from the
            on DNA workflow.
        </p>
        <img src='assets/pages/global/image2.png' style='width:800px'>
        <p>
            The workflow has 1 step in it which creates a 'Question Task'. The Yes response activates workflow A and the
            No response activates workflow B.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clients Tasks current 1 Task:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you want to charge a DNA? [Question]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If the clinician responds No to the question then workflow B would be activated and the tasks would look
            like
            this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you want to charge a DNA? [Question - NO] [COMPLETE]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If the clinician responds Yes to the question then workflow A would be activated and the new tasks would
            look
            like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do you want to charge a DNA? [Question - YES] [COMPLETE]</li>
            <li>Invoice for DNA. [Task]</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="s1-3">What is a Trigger?</h2>
        <p>A trigger is an event that occurs. An example of this is when you create an appointment. When you click to
            save the appointment, the event of saving an appointment has occurred. In inClinic it is described as the
            appointment 'on create' trigger.</p>
        <p>
            The trigger can be used to run a workflow when it occurs. So to follow the example above, when the
            appointment is saved it triggers the activation of the workflow that sends an email out to the client to
            confirm the appointment.
        </p>
        <p>In settings, under the company section is the tab for triggers. These are the default triggers for inClinic.
        </p>
        <h3 id='s1-3-1'>Appointment Triggers</h3>
        <p>
            In settings, under the company section is the tab for triggers. These are the default triggers for inClinic
            and can be over ridden if there are values set in the appointment type settings.
        </p>
        <p>There are currently four types of appointment triggers:</p>
        <ul class='a-loose-list list-disc ml-6 mt-6 '>
            <li><b>On Create</b> - Activated when the appointment is saved.</li>
            <li><b>On Change</b> - When a current appointment is updated.</li>
            <li><b>On Attend</b> - When the clinician sets the appointment status to attended.</li>
            <li><b>On DNA</b> - When the clinician sets the appointment status to did not attend.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id='s1-3-2'>Appointment Type Triggers</h3>
        <p>In Settings, under the appointment types, select an appointment type and then look at the triggers tab.</p>
        <p>
            As described above it contains appointment triggers. If these are added then they will take precedents over
            the
            default ones set in the company settings.
